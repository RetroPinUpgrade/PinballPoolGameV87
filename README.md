Note: This version uses the Arduino Mega and adapter Revision 3 that connects to J5 on your Bally compatible MPU card. It is not currently compatible with RetroPinballUpdate cards that install in the CPU socket.

Read the "Prepare your pinball for use with RPU" document for specific set up instructions. Download all files here to compile onto your Arduino. This game version has been updated to the new Retro Pinball Update OS.

The new roaming mode replaces the original middle Ball Chase mode. The code has many updates including new sound effects to clarify game actions.
